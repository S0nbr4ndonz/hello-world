# hello-world
This repository will work as a way for me to practice git workflow

My name is Brandon Hernandez-Cano. I am a student at California State University, Monterey Bay. 

I love coding and creating in general, but specifically I enjoy full-stack web development and working with databases. I want to learn more about Operating Systems, network security, and creating advanced projects using python or c++.
